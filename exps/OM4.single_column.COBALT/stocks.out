 S(t) = Total amount     of a tracer in the component model at time t.
        Calculated via the component model itself.
  
 F(t) = Cumulative input of a tracer to the component model at time t.
        Calculated via interchange of fluxes with other component models.
  
 S(t) - S(0) = Cumulative increase of the component stocks at time t
               Calculated by the component itself.
  
 In a conserving component F(t)=S(t)-S(0) to within numerical accuracy.
  
 Component Model refers to one of OCN, ATM, LND or ICE
 
 NOTE: When use_lag_fluxes=.true. is used in coupler, the ocean stocks 
       calculations are in error by an order which scales as the inverse
       of the number of time steps.
